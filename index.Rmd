# External Resources

-   List of color names in R: <http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf>

# Assignment and Data Manipulation

## `<-`

-   Assigns a value to a name
-   `name <- value`

## `read.csv(file, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)`

-   `file` is the name of the file from which data are to be read
-   `stringsAsFactors` should generally be set to `TRUE` (all caps): this determines how text-like data in a CSV file is interpreted by R.

## `$`

-   what is a dollar sign really
-   `data_set_name$data_set_variable`

## `subset(data, subset)`
- `data` is the name of the data.frame you want to make a subset of
- `subset` is a logical expression indicating rows to keep. Remember to use "logical equals", `==` to test for equality; you can use regular comparison operators as well, like `>` for greater than, `<=` for less than or equal to, etc.

# Data Previewing

## `head(x, n)`

-   `x` is a data.frame
-   `n` is the number of rows to print

## `str(object)`

-   `object` is the R object about which you want to have some information (i.e., see the `str`ucture of).

# Numerical Summaries

## `table(data_set_name$data_set_variable)`

-   creates a table of the frequencies of one categorical variable

## `table(data_set_name$data_set_variable, data_set_name$data_set_variable)`

-   creates a two way table of the frequencies of two categorical variables

## `summary(data_set_name$data_set_variable)`

-   creates the five number summary of a quantitative variable

# Graphical Summaries

## `barplot(table(data_set_name$data_set_variable))`

-   creates a barplot of a categorical variable

## `hist(data_set_name$data_set_variable, breaks)`

-   creates a histogram of a quantitative variable
-   `breaks` is the approximate number of breaks you want in the histogram (R will sometimes ignore this to make the plot prettier)

## `boxplot(x, ..., xlab, ylab, main, col)`

-   `x` is the data you want to create a boxplot of
-   `...` is additional data to include in the boxplot

## `plot(x, y, xlab, ylab, main, col)`
- `x` is the variable you want to plot on the x axis
- `y` is the variable you want to plot on the y axis

## Important plotting arguments

Note that since a table is not a plot, these arguments won't work in the `table()` function.

### `main = "Title of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

-   graph title that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `xlab = "x-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

-   the x- (horizontal) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `ylab = "y-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

-   the y- (vertical) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `col = c("color1", ...)`

-   a *vector* of color names enclosed in the `c()` function; e.g., `col = c("red", "blue", "green")`.
