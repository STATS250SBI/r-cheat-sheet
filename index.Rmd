# Assignment and Data Import

### `<-`
- Assigns a value to a name
- `name <- value`

### `read.csv(file, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)`
- `file` is the name of the file from which data are to be read
- `stringsAsFactors` should generally be set to `TRUE` (all caps): this determines how text-like data in a CSV file is interpreted by R.


# Data Previewing

### `head(x, n)`
- `x` is a data.frame
- `n` is the number of rows to print

## `str(object)`
- `object` is the R object about which you want to have some information (i.e., see the `str`ucture of).
